                    This project aims to provide new investor a financial web application to browse through the stock market with machine learning method, including linear regression and recurrent neural network. The model architecture and training function is based on tradition methods that deals with time-series prediction, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) gating mechanism. The project further provides a comparison of using 2 different datasets to train 2 different models. The result is not 100% accurate but a promising predicted trend is given for users to take reference when making trading decision. It is believed that the machine learning principles behind is solid and worth pursuing in financial aspect.
